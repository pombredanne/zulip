Authentication and logging into Zulip the first time
====================================================

(As you read and follow the instructions in this section, if you run
into trouble, check out the troubleshooting advice in [the next major
section](prod-health-check-debug.html).)

Once you've finished installing Zulip, configuring your settings.py
file, and initializing the database, it's time to login to your new
installation.  By default, initialize-database creates 1 realm that
you can join, the `ADMIN_DOMAIN` realm (defined in
`/etc/zulip/settings.py`).

The `ADMIN_DOMAIN` realm is by default configured with the following settings:
* `restricted_to_domain=True`: Only people with emails ending with @ADMIN_DOMAIN can join.
* `invite_required=False`: An invitation is not required to join the realm.
* `invite_by_admin_only=False`: You don't need to be an admin user to invite other users.
* `mandatory_topics=False`: Users are not required to specify a topic when sending messages.

If you would like to change these settings, you can do so using the
Django management python shell (as the zulip user):

```
cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
./manage.py shell
from zerver.models import *
r = get_realm(settings.ADMIN_DOMAIN)
r.restricted_to_domain=False # Now anyone anywhere can login
r.save() # save to the database
```

If you realize you set `ADMIN_DOMAIN` wrong, in addition to fixing the
value in settings.py, you will also want to do a similar manage.py
process to set `r.domain = "newexample.com"`.  If you've already
changed `ADMIN_DOMAIN` in settings.py, you can use
`Realm.objects.all()` in the management shell to find the list of
realms and pass the domain of the realm that is not "zulip.com" to
`get_realm`.

Depending what authentication backend you're planning to use, you will
need to do some additional setup documented in the `settings.py` template:

* For Google authentication, you need to follow the configuration
  instructions around `GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.

* For Email authentication, you will need to follow the configuration
  instructions for outgoing SMTP from Django.  You can use `./manage.py
  send_test_email username@example.com` to test whether you've
  successfully configured outgoing SMTP.

You should be able to login now.  If you get an error, check
`/var/log/zulip/errors.log` for a traceback, and consult the next
section for advice on how to debug.  If you aren't able to figure it
out, email zulip-help@googlegroups.com with the traceback and we'll
try to help you out!

You will likely want to make your own user account an admin user,
which you can do via the following management command:

```
./manage.py knight username@example.com -f
```

Now that you are an administrator, you will have a special
"Administration" tab linked to from the upper-right gear menu in the
Zulip app that lets you deactivate other users, manage streams, change
the Realm settings you may have edited using manage.py shell above,
etc.

You can also use `./manage.py knight` with the
`--permission=api_super_user` argument to create API super users,
which are needed to mirror messages to streams from other users for
the IRC and Jabber mirroring integrations (see
`bots/irc-mirror.py` and `bots/jabber_mirror.py` for some detail on these).

There are a large number of useful management commands under
`zerver/manangement/commands/`; you can also see them listed using
`./manage.py` with no arguments.

One such command worth highlighting because it's a valuable feature
with no UI in the Administration page is `./manage.py realm_filters`,
which allows you to configure certain patterns in messages to be
automatically linkified, e.g., whenever someone mentions "T1234", it
could be auto-linkified to ticket 1234 in your team's Trac instance.

it depends on](prod-health-check-debug.html).
