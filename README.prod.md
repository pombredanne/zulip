Zulip in production
===================

This documents the process for installing Zulip in a production environment.

Note that if you just want to play around with Zulip and see what it
looks like, it is easier to install it in a development environment
following the instructions in README.dev, since then you don't need to
worry about setting up SSL certificates and an authentication mechanism.
